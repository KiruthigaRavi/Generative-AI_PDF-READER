# WORKING
"DocQuest: Interactive Document Reader and Q&A Assistant" is an innovative project designed to streamline the process of extracting and retrieving information from multiple PDF documents. The primary objective of DocQuest is to enable users to interactively query a collection of PDFs and receive precise and relevant answers. This system leverages advanced natural language processing techniques(OCR techniques)  to extract text from PDFs, convert the text into vector representations and store these vectors in a vector database. Upon receiving a query, DocQuest uses sentence embeddings to find the most relevant text snippets from the document collection and generate concise answers. This tool aims to enhance productivity and efficiency by providing quick and accurate responses to user queries, making it an invaluable resource for professionals handling large volumes of textual data.
